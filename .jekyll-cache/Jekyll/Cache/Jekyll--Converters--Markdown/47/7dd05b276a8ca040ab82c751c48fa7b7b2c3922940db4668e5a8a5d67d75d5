I"<p>We add supplementary plots that are tested in the paper to provide additional context. In the paper, we only reported plots of the results of SLAC and PPO-LSTM, as they performed best (and only for the first year).</p>

<p>We report the first five years of training to test the data efficiency of the algorithms, as well as the results of the test location (after 20 years of training).</p>

<p>The parameters of the experiment are slightly different than the ones of our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921005961?via%3Dihub">previous paper</a>, explaining the different results (for example, SAC in this paper has a better data efficiency). We used the same weather files than in the above paper. Note that we never reuse the same weather files again to ensure that no information about the future is leaked.</p>

<p>For the energy consumption plot, we used a moving average over 4 days to keep the plots legible. There are large variations in day-night cycles and it would be difficult to compare the different algorithms otherwise.</p>

<p>For the temperature control plots, we take a moving average over 3 hours.</p>
