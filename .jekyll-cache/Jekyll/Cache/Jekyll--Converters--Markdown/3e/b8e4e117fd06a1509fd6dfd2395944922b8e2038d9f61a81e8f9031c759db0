I"Ì<p>Due to the importance of hyperparameters in RL experiments, we aim to provide more details here. Due to the limited page requirements, it was not realistically possible to include it in the original paper. As a disclamer, the architectures differ largely in size, therefore this paper is not meant to be a benchmark study between the algorithms, but more to show that using methods for POMDPs can be valuable for some applications in energy management.</p>
