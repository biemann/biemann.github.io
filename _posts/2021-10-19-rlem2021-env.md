This post describes the environment used in the paper more in detail. We performed our experiments on the open source two-zone data centre environment of [Moriyama et. al](https://github.com/IBM/rl-testbed-for-energyplus). We recommend taking a look at [their paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10427), that describes the environment in far greater detail.

The HVAC system of the data centre can be described in the following image:

The experiments are done with EnergyPlus v.9.2.0

### Observation space

We used a 5 dimensional observation space:

|Variable | Range| Unit |
|---|---|---|
|Outdoor air temperature | [-20,50] | °C |
|West zone air temperature | [-20,50] | °C |
|East zone air temperature | [-20, 50] | °C |
|IT equipment demand power | [0,1] | GW |
|HVAC equipment demand power | [0,1] | GW |

### Action space

We have a 4 dimensional action space:

|Variable | Range | Unit |
|---|---|---|
|West zone temperature setpoint | [10,40] | °C |
|East zone temperature setpoint | [10,40] | °C  |
|West zone fan mass flow rate | [1.75, 7.0] | kg/s |
|East zone fan mass flow rate | [1.75, 7.0] | kg/s|

### Weather files

We used the [official EnergyPlus weather](https://energyplus.net/weather) files for our experiments from the following locations:
 
| Years 1-10 | Years 11-20 |
|---|---|
|Oslo | Hamburg |
|Bergen |Düsseldorf |
|Stockholm| Bremen |
|Karlstad| Saint Petersburg|
|Kiruna | Dundee|
|Göteborg | Amsterdam|
|Tampere | Groningen|
|Helsinki | Gdansk|
|Berlin| Szcezcin|

The test location uses weather data from Copenhagen. In retroperspective, training for 20 years is very long and not necessary for all algorithms except PPO.

### Modifications from the original environment

We performed small modifications to the original environment in order to implement algorithms that are not implemented with OpenAI Baselines. OpenAI Baselines normalises the state and action space automatically, but this is not the case of other implementations that assume that the environment is normalised.

We modified the following block in `rl-testbed-for-energyplus/gym_energyplus/envs/energyplus_model_2ZoneDataCenterHVAC_wEconomizer_Temp_Fan.py ` from 

```
lo = 10.0
hi = 40.0
flow_hi = 7.0
flow_lo = flow_hi * 0.25
self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=np.array([lo,lo,flow_lo,flow_lo]),
                               high=np.array([hi,hi,flow_hi,flow_hi]),
                               dtype=np.float32)
self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=np.array(
            [-20.0, -20.0, -20.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
            high=np.array(
            [50.0,50.0,50.0,1000000000.0,1000000000.0,1000000000.0]),
            dtype = np.float32)
```

to:

```
self.low_action = np.array([10.0, 10.0, 1.75, 1.75])
self.high_action = np.array([40.0, 40.0, 7.0, 7.0])

self.low_obs = np.array([-20.0, -20.0, -20.0, 0.0, 0.0])
self.high_obs = np.array([50.0, 50.0, 50.0, 1e9, 1e9])

self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=-1,high=1,shape=(4,),dtype=np.float32)
self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1,high=1,shape=(5,),dtype=np.float32)
```

We also need to change the following in `rl-testbed-for-energyplus/gym_energyplus/envs/energyplus_model.py`  in `set_action(self, normalized_action)`from

```
self.action_prev = self.action
self.action = self.action_space.low + 
      (normalized_action + 1.) * 0.5 * 
      (self.action_space.high - self.action_space.low)
self.action = np.clip(
      self.action, self.action_space.low, self.action_space.high)
```

to:

```

self.action_prev = self.action
self.action = np.clip(self.action,
     self.action_space.low, self.action_space.high)
self.action = self.low_action + (normalized_action + 1.) 
    * 0.5 * (self.high_action - self.low_action)
```

Finally, we did the following modifications to the EnergyPlus controller file. With this change, we were able to reproduce the results by Moriyama et. al. in their paper. In `2ZoneDataCenterHVAC_wEconomizer-baseline.idf` (l. 2984), we changed the air flow calculation method.

```
 ElectricEquipment:ITE:AirCooled,
    EastDataCenter_Equip,    !- Name
    East Zone,               !- Zone Name
    !FlowControlWithApproachTemperatures,  !- Air Flow Calculation Method
    FlowFromSystem,            ! New Air Flow Calculation Method
```

### Modifications to the libraries

We mostly kept the code implementations intact, except for some hyperparameters we tuned. Some small modifications were nonetheless necessary.

We modified the SLAC implementation by [Han et. al.](https://github.com/oist-cnru/Variational-Recurrent-Models) in the following two ways:

1. We avoid resetting the environment after 1000 steps. Resetting the environment means starting a new year. Instead of resetting, we continue the experiment in the same episode.
2. We modified the implementation to make it run on a GPU.

We also did the modification #1 in the implementation of [SAC-LSTM](https://github.com/quantumiracle/Popular-RL-Algorithms) from Ding.
